# Parallel Task Bench (PTB)

PTB is a collection of benchmarks to measure tasking performance and tasking-related features.  Currently it includes benchmark as listed below. In general, such benchmarks are useful to evaluate compiler language support as well as its efficient implementations. 

## PTB Benchmarks
- interop/heat
- interop/example
- interop/osu-micro-bench
- interop/tric
- reductions/dot (Dot Product)
- reductions/fib (Fibonacci)
- reductions/powerset (Powerset Permutations)
- reductions/powerset-final (Powerset Permutations using the final OpenMP clause)
- reductions/powerset-UDR (Powerset Permutations using user-defined reductions)
- reductions/others/array_sum (Array Sum)
- reductions/others/knapsack (Knapsack)
- reductions/others/knightstour (Knights Tour)
- reductions/others/max_height_tree (Max Height)
- reductions/others/nbinarywords (n-Permutations)
- reductions/others/nqueens (N-Queens)
- reductions/others/TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem)
